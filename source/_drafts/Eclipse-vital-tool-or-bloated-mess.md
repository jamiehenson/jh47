No, this post isn't about The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. Nobody sparkles here, I don't have a six pack or turn into a dog, and like to have more than one dead-faced expression in myÂ repertoire. Imagine that.

Eclipse is a leviathan of a program, something called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). It's supposed to help with programming, especially when you're working on a project with many files. The $40-million-turned-open-source baby from IBM, it's considered the "industry standard" (whatever that phrase means), has a colossal user base, and has a legion of extensions and plugins. But how useful is it? And who would benefit from it?

I see three kinds of programmers. The enthusiastic hobbyists, the learners (me), and the veterans. For weekend programmers, the chances are that the scale of any project being worked on is relatively small, and so you only need to cut that slice of bread with a small knife instead of a fire axe. However, the get-up-and-go project functionality that IDEs offer is appealing for just getting something set up and working in no time. Plus, they tend to hand-hold you through writing relatively standard sections of code - especially in the case of Java in Eclipse.
