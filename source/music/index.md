As I said in my "About Me" page, I love music. Instead of spending time trying to explain my music tastes, take a look at my last.fm - feel free to [add me](http://www.last.fm/user/jhenson47).

I play guitar, bass, drums and a bit of keys - self-taught from countless hours spent experimenting with multi-tracking and composition in my teens.

These days I'm the bass player of [The Bristol Hornstars](http://bigbandsoc.co.uk) and [Dubbed Over](http://www.dubbedover.co.uk). I write some compositions myself, but since I'm an abysmal vocalist, they never usually progress past the experimental stage!

Happy days. Catch me on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/jhenson47), [Soundcloud ](http://soundcloud.com/jhenson/)and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/tufty47).
