# Jamie Henson

The last time I edited this page was in 2011, so I thought I'd bring it into the modern times. My name's Jamie, MEng Computer Science graduate from Bristol, originating from the village-y parts around Stoke-on-Trent before that. Currently I am living in San Francisco, CA working for Caring.com as a software engineer.

Technology is a notable interest of mine, as proven via my enthusiasm when powering through a Master's degree in computers and that, but music is my true love. I would like nothing more than to bring the two camps closer together, making applications and interfaces that appeal to musicians and technophiles alike. I've built two musical interfaces throughout the course of my studies, [Kugelschwung](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/nime2012/Proceedings/papers/131_Final_Manuscript.pdf) and Making Waves, the former of which was accepted into the international [NIME](http://www.nime.org/) conference in 2012 - the second currently pending (sort of).

Aside from typing away in a darkened room, I'm a multi-instrumentalist and general bass-for-hire around Bristol, currently serving my third year in the auditioned Bristol University Big Band Society (two years in [BUJO](http://bigbandsoc.co.uk/bujo/), this one in [The Bristol Hornstars](http://bigbandsoc.co.uk/hornstars/)). In my own time, I write more music of my own.
