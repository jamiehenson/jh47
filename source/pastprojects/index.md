This page is all about the things I've worked on, computer-wise, over the years. I imagine it will accumulate as I head through my degree!

### Uni:

Year Two:

*   Image blurring filter that fully utilises a four-core processor, in XC
*   Matrix operation calculator, in C
*   Polynomial multiplication and pattern matching (exact and wildcard-based) using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), in Java
*   Automatic document creation system from EMF Models (a job for IBM), in Java for use with Eclipse
*   One-dimensional particle simulation using concurrent processing, in XC
<div>Year One:</div>

*   An emulator of the ARM processor (or at least a partial subset of the instruction set) written in C
*   Word-searching program for scanning text files in C
*   Emulation of a processor ALU in Verilog
*   DES-Encryption implemented in Verilog
*   A battle robot using [Robocode ](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/)(written in Java, software's free, have a go yourself!)
*   Reverse-Polish notation calculator in Haskell with support for quadratic equations
*   Shape dimension calculators in Haskell

### College and back:

*   MoorMaths - a GCSE Maths revision aid program for Moorside High School (includes interactive revision materials, randomly generated questions of varying difficulties in a test environment, performance tracking and targets for students)
*   An electronic administration system for Moorland Architectural Services
*   SWAG! - a detective game intended for 7+ involving forensics and crime-scene searching
<div>

### Spare time:

*   A Java implementation of [Bogosort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) - the world's worst sorting algorithm! (runs in O(infinity) time, and once took 45 minutes to sort 10 numbers!) (_[download](http://jh47.com/code/bogosort.java)_)
*   Numbertricks - a Java number attributes analyser that I continually add to (_[visit page](http://jh47.com/pastprojects/numbertricks)_)
*   Incremental Character Rotator encryption program for scrambling text uniquely to a user defined 8-digit key (_[download](http://jh47.com/files/icr.zip)_)
*   Simple ROT13 encoder (_[download](http://jh47.com/files/ROT13.zip)_)
</div>
Below is a table of games I have written (not very many, haha) either by myself or with others, and below that is a table of general things I have worked on. I would host them on here to download, but most of them are college/University items so I don't want to spoil the fun for any others doing the same assignment ;).
